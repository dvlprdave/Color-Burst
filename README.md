##Color-Burst
A color palette creater to help build your next project. 
 
There are six pre-made palettes to choose from. If you'd like to start clean, each pre-made palette can be deleted. 

###Creating A Palette
When creating a palette, nineteen colors will be generated for you. You may clear these colors and add your own or simply generate a series of random colors. All colors in this area are draggable and can be individually deleted. The option to select colors based on rgba and hsla are also available. 

###Getting Palette Color Codes
Once you've created a palette, each color code is available for copy. If you'd like to see the luminance range for a specific color, simply click "more" and you'll be presented with shades from 100-900. Each color code can be copied in either HEX, RGB RGBA.
